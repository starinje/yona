## üõ† Local Development

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/starinje/yona.git
cd yona
```

### 2. Install Nix

This project uses Nix to ensure that developers' local environments are all the same.

To install Nix, run the following command at the root level of the `yona` directory:

```bash
make install-nix
```

### 3. Start Nix

To enter the Nix shell and set up your development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nix-shell
```

This command creates an isolated environment based on your `shell.nix` file, allowing you to access all specified tools and dependencies. You can exit the Nix shell by typing `exit` or pressing `Ctrl + D`. For more information about Nix, visit the [Nix website](https://nixos.org/nix/).

### 4. Start the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
make start
```

This command will launch the application in the background.

### 5. Stop the Application

To stop the application, use:

```bash
make stop
```

This command will terminate the running application.

### 6. Run Backend Tests

To run the tests for the application, execute:

```bash
make test-backend
```

This command will run all the defined tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
