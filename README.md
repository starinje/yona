### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Install Nix

This project uses Nix to ensure that developers' local environments are all the same.

To install Nix, run the following command at the root level of the `yona` directory:

```bash
make install-prerequisites
```

### 3. Start Nix

To enter the Nix shell and set up your development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

```

This command creates an isolated environment based on your `shell.nix` file, allowing you to access all specified tools and dependencies. You can exit the Nix shell by typing `exit` or pressing `Ctrl + D`. For more information about Nix, visit the [Nix website](https://nixos.org/nix/).
